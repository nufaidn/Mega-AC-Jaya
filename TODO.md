# TODO List for Task: Add h-screen to sections and center text in pages

## Files to Edit
- [ ] resources/views/pages/about.blade.php
- [ ] resources/views/pages/service.blade.php
- [ ] resources/views/pages/gallery.blade.php
- [ ] resources/views/pages/contact.blade.php

## Steps for Each File
1. Identify all <section> elements.
2. Add `h-screen` class to each section.
3. Remove or adjust padding classes (e.g., `py-20`) to allow full height.
4. Add `flex items-center justify-center` to center the content.
5. Wrap content in a flex container if needed.

## Testing
- [ ] Open each page in browser to verify sections are full height and text is centered.
